# User Guide Content Guidelines

## Writing Principles

### Beginner-Friendly
- No jargon or technical terms without explanation
- Assume user has never used calendar sync before
- Explain WHY, not just HOW

### Comprehensive
- Cover "What is this?" section
- Explain "How it works" in simple terms
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Include common scenarios and use cases
- Add tips and best practices

### Structure
Each guide follows this pattern:
1. **Introduction** - What this page does (emoji header)
2. **Concepts** - Explain key ideas clearly
3. **Instructions** - Step-by-step how-to
4. **Details** - Additional information
5. **Tips/Warnings** - Helpful advice and cautions
6. **Common Scenarios** - Real-world examples

## Formatting

### Sections
Use `<div class="guide-section">` for logical grouping.

### Headings
- `<h3>` for main title with emoji
- `<h4>` for subsections

### Lists
Use `<ul>` for features/options, `<ol>` for sequential steps.

### Emphasis
Use `<strong>` for important terms and concepts.

### Special Callouts
- Tips: `<p class="help-tip">üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> ...</p>`
- Warnings: `<p class="help-warning">‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Note:</strong> ...</p>`

## Tone
Friendly, encouraging, and supportive. Guide users like a helpful colleague.
