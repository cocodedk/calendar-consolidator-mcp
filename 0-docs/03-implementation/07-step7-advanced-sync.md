# Step 7: Advanced Sync Features (Phase 2)

## Goal
Add continuous sync, error handling, and sync rules

## Tasks

### Continuous Sync Scheduler
- [ ] Create scheduler module
- [ ] Implement periodic sync loop
- [ ] Read interval from settings
- [ ] Run sync for each source
- [ ] Handle overlapping syncs
- [ ] Add start/stop controls

### Error Handling & Retry
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff
- [ ] Add max retry attempts
- [ ] Distinguish transient vs permanent errors
- [ ] Log error details
- [ ] Continue on single-event failures
- [ ] Skip problematic sources temporarily

### Conflict Resolution
- [ ] Define conflict scenarios
- [ ] Implement resolution strategies
- [ ] Always prefer source over target
- [ ] Handle duplicate detection
- [ ] Test conflict scenarios

### Sync Rules Engine
- [ ] Define rule types
- [ ] Implement ignore private events rule
- [ ] Implement time window filter rule
- [ ] Implement calendar name filter rule
- [ ] Add custom field mapping rules
- [ ] Test rule application

## Files to Create
- `python/sync/scheduler.py`
- `python/sync/retry_handler.py`
- `python/sync/conflict_resolver.py`
- `python/sync/rules_engine.py`

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Continuous sync runs on schedule
- [ ] Errors trigger retry
- [ ] Backoff delays work correctly
- [ ] Sync resumes after errors
- [ ] Rules filter events correctly
- [ ] Private events respected
- [ ] Multiple sources coordinate

## Time Estimate
- 8-10 hours
