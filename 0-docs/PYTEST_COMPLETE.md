# Pytest Suite - Complete ✅

## Summary
- **81 tests** created across 27 files
- **100% passing** (81/81)
- **62% code coverage** of core modules
- **All files < 100 lines** (36-82 lines each)

## Test Coverage
- **Model** (8 files): Event creation, conversion, hashing, diff logic
- **State** (13 files): Database, encryption, stores (source/mapping)
- **Sync** (7 files): Syncer operations, error handling, integration

## Key Achievements
✅ **100% coverage**: diff.py, mapping_store.py, source_store.py
✅ **95% coverage**: syncer.py
✅ **96% coverage**: encryption.py
✅ All external dependencies mocked (keyring, sqlite3, Graph API)

## Run Tests
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pytest                    # All tests
pytest tests/model/       # Model tests only
pytest tests/state/       # State tests only
pytest tests/sync/        # Sync tests only
pytest --cov=python       # With coverage
```

## Files Created
- 27 test files (tests/model/, tests/state/, tests/sync/)
- 1 conftest.py (shared fixtures)
- 1 pytest.ini (configuration)
- 1 run_tests.sh (test runner script)
- Tests README in tests/

## Next Steps
Add tests for:
- CalDAV connector (Phase 2)
- Log store
- Settings store
- Target store
- Dry-run syncer
