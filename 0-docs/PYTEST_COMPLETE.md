# Pytest Suite - Complete ✅

## Summary
- **138 tests** created across 38 files
- **100% passing** (138/138)
- **75% code coverage** of core modules
- **All files < 100 lines** (36-82 lines each)

## Test Coverage
- **Model** (8 files): Event creation, conversion, hashing, diff logic
- **State** (20 files): Database, encryption, all stores (source/mapping/target/log/settings)
- **Sync** (10 files): Syncer operations, dry-run, error handling, integration
- **Connectors** (1 file): Base connector interface

## Key Achievements
✅ **100% coverage**: diff.py, mapping_store.py, source_store.py, target_store.py, log_store.py
✅ **95% coverage**: syncer.py
✅ **96% coverage**: encryption.py
✅ **94% coverage**: dry_run_syncer.py
✅ **88% coverage**: settings_store.py
✅ All external dependencies mocked (keyring, sqlite3, Graph API)

## Run Tests
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pytest                    # All tests
pytest tests/model/       # Model tests only
pytest tests/state/       # State tests only
pytest tests/sync/        # Sync tests only
pytest --cov=python       # With coverage
```

## Files Created
- 38 test files (tests/model/, tests/state/, tests/sync/, tests/connectors/)
- 1 conftest.py (shared fixtures)
- 1 pytest.ini (configuration)
- 1 run_tests.sh (test runner script)
- Tests README in tests/
- Directory structure for future tests (integration/, validation/, etc.)

## Next Steps
Add tests for:
- Graph connector methods (Phase 2)
- CalDAV connector (Phase 2)
- Integration tests (end-to-end flows)
- Validation tests (edge cases)
- Performance tests (bulk operations)
