    <h3>📚 About Source Calendars</h3>
    <p>Sources are the calendars you want to sync FROM. Think of them as the
    calendars that contain events you want to see in your consolidated view.</p>
</div>

<div class="guide-section">
    <h4>How Source Calendars Work</h4>
    <p>When you add a source calendar:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Calendar Consolidator connects to that calendar service</li>
        <li>It reads events from those calendars (read-only access)</li>
        <li>Events are copied to your target calendar during sync</li>
        <li>Your original calendars remain completely unchanged</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help-tip">💡 <strong>Safe & Secure:</strong> We only READ from source
    calendars. Your original events are never modified or deleted.</p>
</div>

<div class="guide-section">
    <h4>How to Add a Source Calendar</h4>

    <h4>Supported Calendar Providers</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Microsoft 365 / Outlook:</strong> Personal, work, or school accounts</li>
        <li><strong>Google Calendar:</strong> Gmail and Google Workspace accounts</li>

<div class="guide-section">
    <h4>Managing Your Sources</h4>
    <p><strong>Active Status:</strong> Shows whether a source is currently being synced.
    Inactive sources won't be included in synchronization.</p>
    <p><strong>Removing a Source:</strong> Click the "Remove" button to stop syncing
    from a calendar. Events already copied to your target calendar will remain there.</p>

    and shared project calendars as separate sources.</p>
