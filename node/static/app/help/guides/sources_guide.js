    <h3>ðŸ“š About Source Calendars</h3>
    <p>Sources are the calendars you want to sync FROM. Think of them as the
    calendars that contain events you want to see in your consolidated view.</p>
</div>

<div class="guide-section">
    <h4>How Source Calendars Work</h4>
    <p>When you add a source calendar:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Calendar Consolidator connects to that calendar service</li>
        <li>It reads events from those calendars (read-only access)</li>
        <li>Events are copied to your target calendar during sync</li>
        <li>Your original calendars remain completely unchanged</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help-tip">ðŸ’¡ <strong>Safe & Secure:</strong> We only READ from source
    calendars. Your original events are never modified or deleted.</p>
</div>

<div class="guide-section">
